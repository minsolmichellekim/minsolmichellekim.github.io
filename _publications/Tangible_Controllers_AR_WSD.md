Drivers across the world spend a significant amount of time traveling and they often perform personal and work-related activities during their commute. The introduction of automated vehicles will allow them to reclaim some of their driving time by safely engaging in various complex non-driving-related tasks. Augmented reality (AR) windshield displays (WSDs) offer promising ways to safely present non-driving-related tasks in automated vehicles when automation is engaged. Previous studies explored different modalities like voice commands, gestures, and gaze to interact with WSDs. In this pictorial, we explore haptic methods of in-car interactions with WSDs and tangible user interfaces (TUIs). We envision our tangible interfaces, differing from conventional infotainment systems by serving as a non-intrusive remote controller supplement to WSDs. We propose two prototypes: a steering wheel attachable controller and a cup-sleeve-shaped device that aims to support the driver's ability to manipulate WSDs and efficiently transition to and from driving.
